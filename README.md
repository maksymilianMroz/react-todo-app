This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A simple application made in react.js

**The application was made as a recruitment task, so it differs from the standard todo-app. There is no room to enter your own texts. After clicking the button `ADD`, the application adds a task with the next number. After clicking the button `REMOVE`, it removes the last task. When the button `CLEAR` is clicked, all tasks are cleared.**

## How to run it?

You can use link: https://maksymilianmroz.github.io/react-todo-app/

or download entire repository and in the project directory, you can run(use some terminal-like tool):

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
